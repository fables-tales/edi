#edi

edi is a simple command line tool that attempts to boost productivity. Instead of having
to point your editor as files as you're slinging around a project, use edi.

edi is configured with `edi set [file]` which will have edi open `file` when the main
`edi` command is typed.

##Todos:
 * Make edi have queue and stack based editing
 * Make edi automatically queue conflicting files in a git merge situation
